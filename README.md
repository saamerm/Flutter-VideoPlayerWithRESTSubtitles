# FlutterMobile
 Practicing with some flutter code. It took me less than 3 days to build all of this from scratch- including installing flutter, and converting the screenshot into a Figma design. 

I was able to get the UI done really quick thanks to the Figma-Zeplin integration and Zeplin's Flutter extension that gave me the right controls to use. 

## Introduction

* Use of 3rd party libraries
* Flutter Page lifecycle events
* Making HTTP Service calls to REST APIs and consuming them
* Routing between pages
* Usage of DART for software development
* Usage of Flutter APIs and Widgets for creation of views
* Updating required platform specific configurations
